# professional-README-generator

## Description
The objective of this project was to create a program that can generate a quality README.md. The user is prompted with questions when the program is ran and then the README is created
using the provided answers. The program uses the Inquirer.js command line interface to present the questions to the user. The generated README will have sections for the project name, description,
table of contents, usage, license (if chosen), contributors, and questions.
